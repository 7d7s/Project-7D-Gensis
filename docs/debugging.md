# Debugging Guide for NextGen MedTech Backend

This guide provides best practices and steps for debugging issues in the production environment.

## 1. Logging & Tracing
- Ensure all microservices use structured logging (Serilog/ELK).
- Enable distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) for request correlation.

## 2. Common Debugging Steps
1. Check service logs for errors or stack traces.
2. Use tracing dashboards to follow request paths.
3. Use Prometheus/Grafana for performance and resource monitoring.
4. For API errors, inspect API Gateway logs and request/response payloads.

## 3. Remote Debugging
- Use Kubernetes port-forwarding or remote debugging tools (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider) with proper security controls.

## 4. Incident Response
- Document and escalate critical incidents.
- Use runbooks for known issues.

## 5. Useful Commands
```sh
kubectl logs <pod> -n <namespace>
kubectl port-forward svc/<service> 8080:80 -n <namespace>
```
