# API Gateway Service Documentation

## Overview
The API Gateway service acts as the central entry point for all client requests in the NextGen MedTech platform. It handles routing, request forwarding, and provides essential cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and rate limiting.

## Key Files

### Program.cs
Location: `backend/api-gateway/NextGenMedTech.ApiGateway/Program.cs`

Main entry point for the API Gateway service with the following responsibilities:
- Application bootstrapping and configuration
- Middleware registration
- Service collection setup
- Routing configuration
- CORS policy setup
- Authentication/Authorization configuration
- Rate limiting setup
- Request/Response transformation
- Error handling

## Core Features

### Request Routing
- Dynamic route configuration based on service discovery
- Intelligent load balancing across service instances
- Path-based routing to appropriate microservices
- Version management for API endpoints

### Security
- JWT token validation
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect integration
- API key validation
- Rate limiting per client/endpoint
- CORS policy enforcement

### Monitoring & Logging
- Request/Response logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and reporting
- Health check endpoints

### Traffic Management
- Circuit breaker implementation
- Retry policies
- Timeout management
- Request throttling

### Integration Points

#### Authentication Service
- Token validation
- User context propagation
- Permission verification

#### Service Discovery
- Dynamic service registration
- Health monitoring
- Load balancing configuration

#### Logging & Monitoring
- Integration with centralized logging
- Metrics export to monitoring systems
- Tracing correlation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`: Runtime environment
- `ApiGateway__AuthService__Endpoint`: Auth service endpoint
- `ApiGateway__RateLimit__RequestsPerMinute`: Rate limiting configuration

### Application Settings
- Routing rules
- Security policies
- Cors configuration
- Rate limiting rules
- Circuit breaker settings

## Deployment

### Dependencies
- .NET Core Runtime 8.0+
- Redis (for rate limiting)
- Service Discovery system

### Health Checks
- `/health`: Basic health check endpoint
- `/health/ready`: Readiness probe endpoint
- `/health/live`: Liveness probe endpoint

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
- Service unavailable
- Rate limit exceeded
- Authentication failures
- Invalid requests
- Timeout scenarios

### Error Responses
- Standardized error format
- Detailed error codes
- Correlation IDs for tracking

## Performance Considerations
- Request caching strategies
- Response compression
- Connection pooling
- Efficient routing algorithms

## Security Considerations
- TLS configuration
- Header validation
- Request sanitization
- Security headers implementation

## Monitoring & Alerting
- Key metrics to monitor
- Alert thresholds
- Performance baselines
- Capacity planning guidelines
