# Theme SDK Guide

This document describes how to develop, package, and deploy custom themes for the NextGen MedTech Platform.

## 1. Overview
- Themes allow for UI customization and branding for each tenant or deployment.
- The Theme SDK provides tools and APIs for theme development.

## 2. Structure
- Each theme is a self-contained package (CSS, JS, images, config).
- Follow the folder structure and naming conventions in the `theme-sdk` directory.

## 3. Development
- Use the provided base theme as a starting point.
- Test themes locally with the platform's dev server.
- Validate compatibility with all supported modules.

## 4. Deployment
- Package the theme as a zip or tarball.
- Upload via the admin dashboard or CLI tool.
- Themes are hot-reloadable in production.

## 5. Best Practices
- Keep themes modular and DRY.
- Document theme variables and configuration options.
