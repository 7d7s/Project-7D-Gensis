## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 PAGE)

### The Opportunity
India's oncology services face a **60% access gap** with 1.56M+ new cancer cases annually. Private sector oncology clinics in Tier 1/Tier 2 cities can address this gap profitably. Government now actively incentivizes day-care cancer centers via ₹1.49 Cr unit grants + PM-JAY (₹5 Lakh/family cancer coverage) + state health mission support.

### The Play: Two Clinic Models
1. **Small Day-Care Chemotherapy Clinic** (20-30 chemo chairs + OPD)
   - CAPEX: ₹8-12 Crore
   - Payback: 3-4 years
   - EBITDA margin: 22-28% at scale
   - Licensing: Moderate complexity (Clinical Establishment + NABL for lab)

2. **Medium Outpatient Oncology Clinic + Diagnostic Hub** (40-50 chemo chairs + pathology lab + tele-oncology)
   - CAPEX: ₹15-25 Crore
   - Payback: 4-5 years
   - EBITDA margin: 24-30% at scale
   - Licensing: High complexity (add NABH accreditation path)

### Investment & Financing
- **CAPEX financing mix**: 40% equity + 40% bank debt (PSB/SIDBI concessional) + 20% vendor finance
- **Govt grants applicable**: PM-JAY empanelment (immediate payer base), DCCC scheme (₹1.49 Cr capex support if applicable), NHM state grants (₹50-70 Lakh for cancer infrastructure)
- **Government support reduces net cash requirement by 15-25%** (via grants + tax benefits)

### 12-Month Path to Launch
| Phase | Duration | Key Milestones | Gate |
|-------|----------|-----------------|------|
| **Setup** | M1-3 | Land secured, PM-JAY applied, team hired | Funding confirmed |
| **Build** | M3-9 | Construction, equipment ordered, CE registered | NABH ready for audit |
| **Launch** | M9-12 | Soft launch OPD, ramp to 50 patients/day | Breakeven operations |

### Breakeven Economics
- **Month 12**: 50-80 OPD patients/day + 300-400 chemo sessions/month = ₹40-60 Lakh monthly revenue
- **Operating margin**: -5% to +5% (near breakeven) by month 12
- **Year 2**: 150-200 OPD/day + 800+ sessions/month = ₹120-180 Lakh monthly revenue; 20%+ EBITDA

### Top 5 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Regulatory delays** (CE, NABH, AERB) | HIGH | Engage consultant early; pre-submission review; timeline buffers (budget 12-18 mo) |
| **Physician talent scarcity** | HIGH | Hire 0.5-1 FTE entry-level; partner with tertiary center for oncologist rotation |
| **Low patient volume ramp** | MEDIUM | Aggressive doctor referral program + employer corporate packages + insurance tie-ups |
| **Insurance reimbursement delay** (DSO 30-60 days) | MEDIUM | Negotiate upfront authorization; factoring line; cash reserves (3 mo OpEx) |
| **Competitive response** (HCG, Apollo expansion) | MEDIUM | Differentiate via affordability, patient experience, specialized services (genomics, palliative) |

### Decision Checkpoint
**GO if all conditions met**:
1. ✅ Chief Medical Officer + 1 senior oncologist identified & committed
2. ✅ ₹8-15 Crore capital commitment (equity + debt structure finalized)
3. ✅ Clinic space identified (1,500-2,500 sq ft) in metro/Tier 1 city
4. ✅ State health society engagement begun (DCCC / NHM grant enquiry)
5. ✅ Regulatory consultant engaged; CE Act adoption status for state confirmed

**NO-GO if**:
- Oncology talent unavailable in target city
- State does not support Clinical Establishment Act (e.g., Delhi, parts of Tamil Nadu)
- Capital commitment below ₹8 Crore or unstructured

- Year 1 EBITDA: -₹480 Lakh

**Scenario: What if OpEx is 20% higher (staff retention bonus, utilities)?**
- Fixed OpEx becomes ₹90 Lakh/mo; breakeven month M12-14
- Payback extends to 4.5-5 years

**Conservative Case (Best Mitigation)**:
- Secure PM-JAY empanelment (guaranteed ₹5L/beneficiary coverage) → reduces DSO from 30 to 7 days
- Pre-launch doctor partnerships (referral base of 500+ oncologists in city) → smoother M1-3 ramp
- Corporate wellness tie-ups (10-15 companies, 1,000-2,000 employees) → predictable volume
- **Result**: Breakeven M8-9; Year 1 EBITDA: -₹200 Lakh; payback 2.5-3 years

## 10. MARKETING, REFERRAL & PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

### Doctor Referral Program (DRP)

**Target**: Build network of 200-300 referring physicians by Month 9

**Components**:
1. **Physician Education Events**
   - Monthly "Oncology Grand Rounds" (lunch-n-learn): 1.5 hours; case discussions + treatment updates
   - Quarterly specialty workshops: Breast cancer, lung cancer, GI cancer (each 2 hours)
   - CME credits: Apply for 4-6 CME points per event (NMC-eligible)

2. **Direct Engagement**
   - Identify high-volume referring physicians (surgery, internal medicine, general practice)
   - In-clinic visits: CMO + nurse present clinic capabilities; provide educational materials
   - Phone/WhatsApp follow-up: Monthly "patient update" (treated, outcomes, satisfaction)
   - Feedback loop: Physician gets SMS when their referred patient completes treatment (outcome closure)

3. **Referral Infrastructure**
   - Simple referral form (1-page): Diagnosis, stage, referral reason, contact info
   - Fax/email acceptance: Acknowledgment within 4 hours
   - Patient appointment scheduling: Within 48 hours of referral
   - Result reporting: Post-treatment summary sent to referring physician
   - Communication protocol: CMO available for phone consultation if complex case

4. **Incentive Structure** (OPTIONAL; ethical considerations)
   - **NOT recommended**: Cash kickbacks or percentage-of-revenue (unethical; violates ASCI code)
   - **Recommended**: 
     - CME sponsorship (free registrations to conferences)
     - Co-authored research papers (if referring physician wants involvement)
     - Joint tumor board presentations (recognition)
     - Patient outcome data shared (improves referring physician's knowledge)

---

### Corporate & Employer Wellness Programs

**Target**: Establish partnerships with 10-15 large corporates (1,000-5,000 employees each)

**Program Components**:
1. **Comprehensive Cancer Care Package**
   - **Preventive screening**: Breast (mammography), cervical (Pap smear), colorectal (endoscopy), prostate (PSA)
   - **Early detection**: Subsidized baseline screening (₹5,000-10,000 per employee)
   - **Treatment**: ₹5-10 Lakh annual benefit cap (chemo + surgery + radiation)
   - **Survivorship**: Post-treatment follow-up, quality of life programs

2. **Employer Communication**
   - Wellness talks: Quarterly sessions at office (1 hour; "Cancer Prevention & Early Detection")
   - Screening camps: Onsite mammography van (breast cancer screening; 50-100 employees/camp)
   - E-newsletter: Monthly "Cancer Awareness" content (diet, exercise, risk factors)
   - Employee helpline: Direct access to oncologist for questions (reduces absenteeism anxiety)

3. **Pricing Model** (B2B)
   - Annual per-employee capitation fee: ₹2,000-5,000 (varies by package)
   - For 2,000 employees: ₹40-100 Lakh annual contract value
   - Markup: 30-40% on cost (clinic benefit: guaranteed volume + upfront cash)
   - Claims management: TPA handles pre-authorization, billing, collections

4. **Key Partners to Approach**:
   - IT companies (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc.): High CSR spend; young workforce
   - Pharma companies: Health-conscious employees; strong wellness budgets
   - Manufacturing: Large workforce; manufacturing hubs (Pune, Bangalore, etc.)
   - Insurance companies: Strategic partners; mutual benefit

---

### Insurance & TPA Partnerships

**Objective**: Secure pre-authorization & faster reimbursement

**Stakeholders**:
- **PM-JAY**: Government scheme (₹5 Lakh/family/year); ~40-50% of clinic revenue target
- **Private Insurance**: ICICI, HDFC, Apollo Health, Bajaj, Max Bupa (~30-35% of revenue)
- **TPAs**: Bajaj Health, ICMR, Star Health, Care, Manipal, Medi Assist (~10-15% delegation)

**Partnership Steps**:
1. **Pre-empanelment Meeting**: Present clinic credentials, infrastructure, oncology expertise
2. **Network Agreement**: Negotiate rates (typically 5-15% discount from standard tariff)
3. **Integration**: EMR connects to TPA pre-auth system (reducing DSO from 30 days to 7-10 days)
4. **Training**: TPA staff trained on clinic workflows; billing staff trained on TPA claim formats
5. **Performance Metrics**: Monthly reconciliation; resolve discrepancies within 10 days

**Rate Negotiation Strategy**:
- Benchmark against peer clinics (5-10% discount acceptable)
- Volume commitments: "If we treat 50 cases/month, grant 10% discount" (incentivizes insurer)
- Network position: Exclusive clinic for oncology in Tier 2 city → higher bargaining power
- Cashless facility: Insurer benefits from direct payment → reduces patient cash burden → increases insurer popularity

---

### NGO & Palliative Care Partnerships

**Objective**: Build brand as compassionate, community-focused oncology center

**Partnerships**:
1. **Cancer Support NGOs**
   - Identify: Cancer Awaareness, Indian Cancer Society, Lokamittra, etc.
   - Activities: Free cancer screening camps (quarterly), patient support groups (monthly), awareness talks (schools/colleges)
   - Benefit to clinic: Community trust, referral network, media coverage, CSR donations (tax-deductible)

2. **Palliative Care Providers**
